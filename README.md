 Weather API



*This application utilizes the Open Weather API, allowing you to choose from five cities in Romania. You can view various weather details for your selected city, including temperature, time, weekday, real feel, sky conditions, and wind speed.
*At the bottom of the page, you can also access a five-day weather forecast, which includes the current day. For each day, you can check the temperature, sky conditions, and real feel of the weather.
*If you scroll to the bottom of the page, a button will appear. You can use this button to quickly return to the top of the page.
The selected cities are saved locally, so the last city you chose will be displayed every time you visit the page.
